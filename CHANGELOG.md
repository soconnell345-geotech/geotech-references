# Changelog

Releases before 1.6.0 are described in their release commits (`git log`).

## Unreleased

**FHWA lookups corrected against the print (review of 2026-11-10, findings
gec-NN).** Each lookup below now returns what its cited page prints. A key
that names no printed row, or more than one, is refused with the printed
rows instead of being answered from the first row that contains the words.

- **Micropile manual (FHWA-NHI-05-039).**
  - `figure_5_23_limiting_lateral_modulus` (Figure 5-23, p. 5-70): three
    bars were wrong. The 9.625"x0.47" 80 ksi casing is 71 psi (490 kPa; it
    returned 1096 kPa, the 7"x0.73" casing's value); hollow bar 73/53 is
    165 psi (1138 kPa; was 2414) and 103/51 is 350 psi (2413 kPa; was
    1138). The 7"x0.73" casing and the #20 bar are added. The result now
    carries the printed psi, the page and the rule of p. 5-68 (no further
    buckling check when Es LIMIT is less than the soil's Es); the docstring
    had the rule reversed. '5.5', '8', '10' and other partial keys are
    refused (gec-03).
  - `table_4_2_rebar_properties` (Table 4-2, p. 4-27): the yield strength
    is the printed column (#18 Grade 520: 1335 kN, was 1342.1; #8 Grade
    420: 211 kN, was 214.2) and the size is the printed 19 to 63 mm. Grade
    550 is the one printed bar, 63 mm (2.5 in), 1747 kN; Grade 550 #14 and
    #18, which the table does not print, are refused (gec-28).
  - `table_5_8_epsilon_50_stiff` (Table 5-8, p. 5-56): the value of the
    printed range, not an interpolation between ranges (su 75 kPa: 0.007,
    was 0.006; 150 kPa: 0.005, was 0.0045; 200 kPa: 0.005, was 0.004). The
    table has no row for 200 to 300 kPa; a strength there is refused
    (gec-18).
  - `table_5_10_soil_modulus_k_clay` (Table 5-10, p. 5-56): the cyclic k
    of soft and medium clay, which the table leaves blank, is refused (it
    returned the static 8140 and 27150 kPa/m) (gec-19).
  - `table_5_11_fixity` (Table 5-11, p. 5-58): the three columns in the
    print's words, with "300 mm or less" and "600 mm or more" and the
    footnote; `table_5_12_elastic_modulus` says where its two sand rows
    differ from the table's kPa column (gec-47).

## 1.6.0

**Local reference packs (REF-64).** A deployment can add its own references
in the library's structured format without putting them in the public
repository or the wheel.

- Set `GEOTECH_REFERENCES_PACKS` to a pack folder or a folder of packs
  (several separated by `os.pathsep`). Each pack holds `pack.json`,
  `text/chapterNN.json` (the chapter schema the built-ins use) and
  optionally `figures_catalog.json` and its PDF. Pack ids start with
  `local_`. Packs hold no code.
- `reference_search`, `reference_get`, `reference_query`,
  `list_indexed_references`, `figure_search`, `figure_get`, `resolve_pdf`
  and the file-based `retrieve_section` family cover packs beside the
  built-in references, with the same ranking and synonym expansion.
- A pack names its PDFs by bare file name only (`pdf_files`, a catalog's
  `pdf_path`). For a pack figure, `resolve_pdf` looks in the pack folder,
  then `GEOTECH_REFERENCES_DOCS`, then raises `FileNotFoundError`; no path
  read from a pack leads outside those folders, and `figure_get` never
  returns a host path for a pack figure.
- A bad pack file cannot break search. A chapter file or catalog the
  indexes cannot take (unreadable JSON, a list or an object where text
  belongs, a PDF named by a path) is skipped and named in
  `_packs.problems()`. Each pack file is indexed under its own SQLite
  savepoint, so one that fails anyway is rolled back while the built-ins
  and the other packs still index.
- The search databases are keyed by the pack set as well as the package
  copy. With the setting unset, every key, every database and every result
  is unchanged.
- A figure catalog may give any figure two optional fields: `bbox` (the
  chart's box on the page, PDF points, top-left origin) and `read_notes` (at
  most 500 characters on how to read it). `figure_get` returns them where
  given; built-in figures carry neither.
- New: `python -m geotech_references.packs new|check|list|index|schema`.
  `check` exits 0 or 1. It checks the schema and the type of every field
  (reported as errors, never tracebacks), the catalog, pages and boxes
  against the PDF with PyMuPDF, print-fidelity warnings and a search smoke
  test. It refuses a pack inside the package or a public repository's work
  tree. `schema` prints the chapter-file schema.
- `chapter_schema.json` moved from `scripts/` into the package and ships in
  the wheel.
- Also new: `scripts/build_figure_catalog.py --pack`,
  `_packs.pack_records()` for build records, and `docs/REFERENCE_PACKS.md`
  (the format, the print-fidelity rules, a minimal chapter file, where packs
  live on each host).
- The chapter schema check moved from `scripts/audit_chapter_text.py` into
  `geotech_references/_schema.py`. The script imports it, and its results
  are unchanged.
